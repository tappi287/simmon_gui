    This option is very useful if you have scripts executed by crontab at small amounts of time.

    Remember that this works by creating a lock file with a filename based on the full path to the script file.

    Providing a flavor_id will augment the filename with the provided flavor_id, allowing you to create multiple singleton instances from the same file. This is particularly useful if you want specific functions to have their own singleton instances.
