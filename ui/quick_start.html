<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<ul class="l">
    <li>1. Install Background Watchman as Windows LogOn Task
        <ul>
            <li>Options > [x] Install Watchman as Windows logon task<br /></li>
            <li>This tiny background process will do all the work for you. The application you see here is 
                just the GUI to configure that background watchman and can be safely closed at any time. You can stop
                the Background Watchman either in this GUI or thru your 
                Windows/Computer management/Planned Tasks/SimmonWatcher_StartUp Windows-Task
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>2. Use the top left [ + ] button to add a Profile. Use an template profile to get started.<br />
    <li>3. [Optional] Define executables to watch. These will trigger your Simmon-Task's when the Executables are
    stopped(Deletion) or started(Creation).<br /></li>
    <li>4. [Optional] Define tasks to execute once the start or stop of one of the executables is detected.<br /></li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Red blinking entries in your Profiles indicate invalid paths. The Background Watchman will ignore these
    and they will not interfere with normal operation.</p>
<p>The Steam Library table below will indicate auto-detected applications with a green background upon refresh.
    The locations to these executables will be automatically updated for you on Profile import or when
    using Profile templates from the top left [ + ] menu.</p>
